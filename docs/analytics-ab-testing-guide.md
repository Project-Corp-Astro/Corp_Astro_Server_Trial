## A/B Testing Framework

### Creating A/B Tests

To create an A/B test, use the A/B testing API:

```javascript
// Example: Creating an A/B test for a new onboarding flow
const testId = await createABTest(
  'new_onboarding_flow',                // Test name
  [
    {                                   // Variants
      name: 'control',                  // Original version
      weight: 50,                       // 50% of users
      config: {
        steps: ['welcome', 'birth_info', 'interests', 'subscription']
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'simplified',               // New version
      weight: 50,                       // 50% of users
      config: {
        steps: ['welcome', 'birth_info', 'subscription']
      }
    }
  ],
  'Testing a simplified onboarding flow with fewer steps', // Description
  new Date(),                           // Start date (now)
  new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // End date (30 days)
);
```
