# Corp Astro Analytics System

This document provides an overview of the Corp Astro Analytics System, explaining its architecture, integration points, and usage guidelines.

## Overview

The Corp Astro Analytics System is designed to track user behavior, feature usage, and business metrics for the Corp Astro mobile application. It provides a comprehensive backend infrastructure for collecting, storing, and analyzing data to drive business decisions and improve user experience.

## System Architecture

The analytics system consists of the following components:

1. **Database Tables**: Store analytics events, user journeys, feature usage, and A/B test data
2. **API Endpoints**: Collect analytics data from the mobile application
3. **Processing Services**: Process and aggregate analytics data
4. **SDK**: Simplifies integration with the mobile application

## Integration Points

### Mobile Application Integration

The mobile application should use the Analytics SDK to interact with the analytics system. The SDK provides methods for:

- Tracking events and user interactions
- Recording feature usage
- Managing user journeys
- Participating in A/B tests

See the [Mobile Analytics Integration Guide](./mobile-analytics-integration-guide.md) for detailed instructions on integrating the SDK with the mobile application.

Example code for the mobile app integration can be found at:
`/src/services/analytics/examples/mobile-sdk-integration.ts`

### Super Admin Panel (SAP) Integration

The Super Admin Panel should use the dashboard data endpoints to retrieve analytics data for visualization. These endpoints provide all the necessary data for building comprehensive dashboards and reports.

The SAP should implement its own dashboard components for visualizing the analytics data. The backend only provides the data through API endpoints; it does not include any frontend visualization components.

See the [Analytics API Documentation](./analytics-api-documentation.md) for detailed information on the available endpoints.

## Database Schema

The analytics system uses the following database tables:

1. **analytics_events**: Stores general analytics events
2. **feature_usage**: Tracks usage of specific features
3. **user_journeys**: Records user progress through defined journeys
4. **ab_tests**: Stores A/B test configurations
5. **ab_test_assignments**: Records which variant a user is assigned to
6. **ab_test_conversions**: Tracks conversions for A/B tests

The database schema is defined in the migration file:
`/src/database/migrations/20250516000001-create-initial-tables.js`

## API Endpoints

### Tracking Endpoints

- `POST /api/analytics/track`: Track a general analytics event
- `POST /api/analytics/feature-usage`: Track feature usage
- `POST /api/analytics/journey`: Track user journey progress
- `POST /api/analytics/ui-interaction`: Track UI interaction
- `POST /api/analytics/batch`: Batch track multiple events
- `POST /api/analytics/ab-test/convert`: Track A/B test conversion
- `GET /api/analytics/ab-test/variant/:testName`: Get assigned variant for a user

### Dashboard Data Endpoints

- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard/metrics`: Get overview metrics
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard/journeys`: Get user journey metrics
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard/ab-tests/:testName`: Get A/B test results

See the [Analytics API Documentation](./analytics-api-documentation.md) for detailed information on these endpoints.

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices for Event Tracking

1. **Be Consistent**: Use consistent naming conventions for events, categories, and actions
2. **Track Meaningful Events**: Focus on tracking events that provide actionable insights
3. **Include Context**: Add relevant properties to events to provide context
4. **Respect Privacy**: Do not track personally identifiable information (PII) unless necessary
5. **Optimize for Performance**: Use batch tracking for high-frequency events

### A/B Testing Guidelines

1. **Clear Hypothesis**: Define a clear hypothesis for each A/B test
2. **Measurable Goals**: Define measurable conversion goals
3. **Sufficient Sample Size**: Run tests with a sufficient sample size for statistical significance
4. **Test Duration**: Run tests for a sufficient duration to account for variations
5. **One Change at a Time**: Test one change at a time to isolate the impact

## Security and Privacy

The analytics system is designed with security and privacy in mind:

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require authentication
2. **Authorization**: Dashboard endpoints require admin privileges
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the API
4. **Data Minimization**: Only collects necessary data
5. **Data Retention**: Implements appropriate data retention policies

## Maintenance and Monitoring

The analytics system includes monitoring capabilities to ensure its reliability:

1. **Error Logging**: Logs errors for troubleshooting
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks API response times
3. **Data Validation**: Validates incoming data to ensure quality
4. **Alerting**: Sends alerts for system issues

## Conclusion

The Corp Astro Analytics System provides a robust infrastructure for tracking and analyzing user behavior in the mobile application. By following the integration guidelines and best practices, you can leverage this system to gain valuable insights and improve the user experience.
