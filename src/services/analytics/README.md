# Corp Astro Analytics System

This directory contains the backend analytics infrastructure for the Corp Astro mobile application. It provides APIs, services, and utilities for tracking user behavior, feature usage, and A/B testing.

## Overview

The analytics system is designed to collect, store, and process data to drive business decisions and improve user experience. It focuses on providing the backend infrastructure needed for the mobile application, while visualization components are implemented in the Super Admin Panel (SAP).

## Key Components

### Analytics SDK

The Analytics SDK provides a simple interface for the mobile application to track events, feature usage, and A/B testing. It handles batching, caching, and offline support automatically.

### Analytics API

The Analytics API provides endpoints for:
- Tracking events and user interactions
- Recording feature usage
- Managing user journeys
- Participating in A/B tests
- Retrieving analytics data for dashboards

### A/B Testing Framework

The A/B testing framework allows for testing different variants of features to optimize user experience. It provides:
- Test creation and management
- Variant assignment
- Conversion tracking
- Results analysis

## Integration

### Mobile App Integration

The mobile application should use the Analytics SDK to interact with the analytics system. Example code for integration can be found in the `examples/mobile-sdk-integration.ts` file.

### Super Admin Panel Integration

The Super Admin Panel should use the dashboard data endpoints to retrieve analytics data for visualization. The API documentation is available in the `/docs/analytics-api-documentation.md` file.

## Development Notes

1. **TypeScript Types**: Ensure all components have proper TypeScript types to maintain code quality.
2. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all components to ensure reliability.
3. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with any changes to the API or SDK.
4. **Performance**: Optimize for mobile performance, especially for batch processing and offline support.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced A/B Testing**: Add more sophisticated statistical analysis for A/B test results.
2. **User Segmentation**: Implement user segmentation for more targeted analytics.
3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Add machine learning capabilities for predictive analytics.
4. **Real-time Analytics**: Implement real-time analytics for critical metrics.
