## Setting Up Project Boards

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Projects" tab

6. Add the columns as described above
7. Configure automation settings for each column
8. Add issues and pull requests to the appropriate columns

## Setting Up Issue Templates

Issue templates have already been created in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory. These templates provide standardized formats for reporting bugs, requesting features, and submitting other types of issues.

## Setting Up Pull Request Templates

A pull request template has already been created in the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file. This template provides a standardized format for submitting pull requests.

## Automation with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflows have been set up to automate various tasks related to project management, including:

- Automatically labeling issues based on content
- Automatically assigning issues to project boards
- Automatically updating issue status based on pull request activity
- Automatically generating release notes

These workflows can be found in the `.github/workflows` directory.
